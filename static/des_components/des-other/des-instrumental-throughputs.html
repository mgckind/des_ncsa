        <strong> Input Data </strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
        The data were derived by William Wester from DECam Calibration system (<a href="https://instrumentation.tamu.edu/instruments/decal/" target="_blank">DECal</a>)
        scans taken over periodic scans from 2012-2016.
        DECal is a spectrophotometric calibration system that uses a 2nm wide tunable source to measure the instrumental response
        function of the telescope from 300nm up to 1100nm. These scans include the transmission function of the instrument including
        the mirror reflection function, filter transmission functions, and ccd quantum efficiency.
        They do not include the atmospheric transmission function.

        Some scans showed measurable out-of-band leakage, particularly with the r filter. Further analysis led us to determine
        that the out-of-band leakage was most likely an artifact of the analysis, and the measurements were consistent with zero.
        Therefore, for each filter the out-of-band transmission was set to zero explicitly.

        The following csv files contain the results of the analysis from William Wester (FNAL).
        The columns are wavelength (in Angstroms, with 50 A steps), an instrumental average throughput, one column for each detector (1-62),
        separate analyses of ccds 31 and 32 amps 1 and 2, and a nominal atmosphere transmission.
        Note that this nominal atmosphere was not used by the FGCM analysis.

        The scans for ccd 2 are compromised because they were taken when ccd 2 was not operational. Please see below for more details.

        <strong> FGCM Data </strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
        Prior to use within the FGCM photometric calibration, these throughputs were modified slightly by Eli Rykoff (SLAC). In particular:
        <ul>
        <li>For CCD 31, the scan from the left (B) amplifier was used (as the other amplifier was non-operational). </li>
        <li> For CCD 2, the throughput was taken as the average of the throughputs of CCD 1 and 3. This captures the spatial variation of the filter,
            but unfortunately not the differences in throughput due to different anti-reflective coatings, particularly noticeable for the g filter. </li>
        <li> The curves have been renormalized so that the i filter throughput in the wavelength range 7350 A < lambda < 8150 A is 1.0. </li>
        </ul>

        These files are distributed as fits files, with each filter cropped to the wavelength range where there is non-zero throughput.
        The files have one row for each wavelength step.
        <ul>
            <li><code>lambda</code>: Wavelength in A. </li>
            <li><code>throughput_avg</code>: Average throughput across the focal plane (normalized to i filter as described).
            <li><code>througput_ccd</code>: 62 columns (for ccd 1 through 62) per-ccd throughput.
        </ul>
        
        Fits files:
        <ul>

     <strong> Caveats </strong>
     </h2>
     <p>
     <ul>
         <li>The red end of the g filter throughput is anomalously high for some detectors due to difficulties subtracting the pupil ghost in the analysis.
         This seems to have negligible effect on broadband photometry.</li>
         <li> A few of the detectors show significant chromatic residuals in the g filter for stars, indicating some systematic errors in the scans.</li>
         <li> The normalization ratio from one filter throughput curve to the next is approximately correct, but there are additional absolute calibration
             adjustments made during final photometric calibration that are not reflected in these transmission curves.</li>
     </ul>
