    <strong>Catalog Overview</strong>
  </h2>

  <p>In <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.501.1282J/">Jarvis, et al (2021)</a>,
  we describe a new software package for modelling the point spread function (PSF) of
  astronomical images, called PIFF (PSFs In the Full FOV), which we applied to the DES Y3 data.
  These PSF models were used for the weak lensing shape measurements to remove the effects of
  the PSF smearing from the galaxy images.</p>
  <p>The catalog available here contains measurements of a set of "reserve" stars (a random
  20% of the initial set of candidate PSF stars), which were
  not used to constrain the PSF models. The catalog includes both measurements of the star
  itself and of the PSF model interpolated to the location of the star.  The differences
  thus serve as fair estimates of the residual errors in the PSF model across the field of view.
  These size and shape measurements were made using the
  <a href=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003MNRAS.343..459H>HSM algorithm</a>.
  These measurements were used for most of the null tests presented in Jarvis, et al.</p>
  These objects are detected in the single-epoch images, and they do not have the COADD_OBJECT_ID
  column that most of the rest of the Y3 catalogs have. RA and DEC columns are provided and it
  should be possible to match these rows to rows in other catalogs via the sky position.</p>

  <p>The catalog is a fits file. It can be downloaded from <a href="http://desdr-server.ncsa.illinois.edu/despublic/y3a2_files/psf/psf_y3a1-v29.fits">here</a>Â </p>

    <strong>Catalog Description - psf_y3a1-v29.fits</strong>
  </h2>
  <p>This catalog contains 56,707,987 objects from a PIFF run.</p>
  <p>This run of PIFF covers all Y3 exposures used for the Y3 meds files in g,r,i,z,Y bands and includes 38287 exposures. The catalogs include measurements of the PIFF models for a set of reserve stars (20%) not used to constrain the PIFF models.</p>
