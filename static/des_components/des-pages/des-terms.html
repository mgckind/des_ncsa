                <u>Services</u>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Registered users agree that as a result of registering for these services they will receive maintenance, administrative, and general announcements by email.
            </p>
            <p>
                Registered users acknowledge that NCSA provides these services “as is”. We are a small team and we are trying to provide an enjoyable and seamless user experience when accessing DES data. NCSA does not make any specific promises about these services except to do the best possible to accomplish our goal. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To provide registered users with a fair and homogeneous experience, service limitations are detailed in each application&apos;s documentation. These limitations include CPU time for long queries and memory resources for performing cutouts for many locations at once, among others. NCSA retains the right to stop any process or job that is consuming more resources than expected.
            </p>
